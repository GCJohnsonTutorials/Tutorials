<CENTER><B>&#x16B1; Expert Backpacking and Travel Guide</B></CENTER><BR><BR>

<B>This Guide</B><HR>
With this guide you can enforce information security and diversion so as to prevent any enemies from gathering any information on you and your location. You will also setup diversion social media accounts and pass around the information to enemies so as to trick anyone you feel is a threat. The diversion social media accounts can be setup with your picture and with a fake name with a fake address and a VoIP phone number that works but with all fake information. If at any point in time anyone connects to these accounts to communicate with them you can continually trick them about your information and your location. You can give out these fake social media accounts and VoIP phone number to anyone you feel is a threat while network blocking them from seeing your real social media accounts and your real information.<BR><BR>

Your real social media Accounts will need to be setup perfectly and they will need to have image galleries and video galleries that host and contain documentation and videos that prove without a reasonable doubt in the legal system that you do not have any diseases. It is also very important to take pictures and record videos of a recent X-Ray of your body and post that to a cloud storage and maybe on your real social media accounts in a private image and video gallery as well as print the picture of your recent X-Ray and give it to close family and friends. You might think this information is automatically known, but it isn't. It is up to you to get this data and post it due to restrictions in information sharing. This process defeats all of the information sharing restrictions from territory to territory and will make it very difficult for anyone to kill you and cover it up.<BR><BR>

You will also learn how to identify people who are drug users and people who have diseases such as HIV / AIDS by identifying HIV Facial Wasting in people / Chlamydia / Gonorrhea / Syphillis / Hepatitis / Malaria / The Flu and other air born and blood born pathogens with virus and bacteria. Malaria is actually a lot more common than most people think. It is claimed on several Internet sources that Western-Europe has eradicated Malaria but this is not true. Malaria can be found all throughout Western-Europe and all throughout the U.S. and Mexico. Malaria is an even worse problem in West-Africa. This is needed so as to protect yourself from anyone who does. Most travelers in the transporation systems that are meant for long distance travel do not have any diseases so you do not need to worry about any of these people because they are usually very clean and very well kept. It is almost impossible to get sick or contract anything from any other travelers in these long distance travel systems. People on Airplanes, Trains and others are usually very safe and very clean. One can easily take a trip to Lake Tahoe, California / Nevada or fly away to Cabo, Mexico or to Sognefjord / Songnefjord, Norway which are very nice and beautiful areas.<BR><BR>

You will also learn which long distance travel systems are safe and which ones are not. Bus systems such as the U.S. Greyhound bus lines are not safe for travel and are very disgusting. All of the electronics and the physical materials in this guide require physical and digital information security hardening. Custom security hardened firmwares for the electronics and more physical processing is required. LinuxBIOS / CoreBoot / LineageOS / Linux OS for Cellular Phone and more. It looks like basic stuff but once physically and digitally hardened this stuff will take care of you.<BR><BR>

This process will make it just about impossible for anyone to get information on you, pick pocket you or switch your stuff out / drug you once you have mastered the training. Not only will you need to protect yourself from the local criminal organizations you will also need to protect yourself from the corrupt Government and any corrupt Law Enforcement in the area. This is extremely realistic information. The world is very dangerous and you will need to know this information so as to protect yourself.<BR><BR>

This process requires a few weeks of training. This combined with other offensive techniques that cannot ever be proved should secure your well-being. It depends on your exact situation but obviously you would want certain people to know where you are at 24/7 while making it impossible for enemies to know where you are at. You can carry all of this stuff around with you in a neat and tidy backpack for an ultra-clean and ulta-organized appearance that is comparable to active duty military.<BR><BR>

The second part of this guide will show you how to pick up on any language and how to memorize 10,000 words in that language in 365 days. According to the U.S. Federal Government and as well as from my own personal experience 10,000 words memorized in any language is extremely fluent. Knowing 10,000 words in any language is enough for fluent readily available conversation with anyone in that language. 2,500 words memorized in any language is also very fluent and is more than enough to identify anything in the area such as street signs and as well as asking people for information. Do not pay attention to the bogus information on the Internet and Television about learning a language. Fluently learning a foreign language takes up to 5 years, but it can be done in 365 days and not less with certain techniques where appriximately ~30 words in that language are fully memorized and retained each and every day. This is actually a lot harder than it looks and sounds. I encourage you to try and memorize 30 words in a foreign language in one day. Chances are you probably can't do it because you don't know how to do it and by the next day you will have forgotton most if not all of the words that you memorized the previous day. No Software Application or book will teach you how to do this. I donâ€™t travel anymore and I will never travel again. But I am now starting to write this expert backpacking guide to help out other travelers.<BR><BR>

With this tried and tested travel system with all of the travel gear that costs approximately $2,500 and then an additional approximate ~$1,200 U.S.D. or more income every 4 weeks is more than sufficient to travel anywhere in the world and change up the location every 2 weeks or less by living in AIRBnBs, Budget Luxury Hostels, Hotels, CouchSurfing or by living in weekly or bi-weekly paid hosting apartments. By combining together promotional deals in a manufactured spending technique you can alway travel first class and live in first class areas without a vehicle or you can always rent a vehicle in the area that you travel to and stay in. Examples of manufactured spending are: signing up for a credit card with a $2,500 limit and then using that credit card to purchase $2,500 of coins from the U.S. Mint which are valid currency and then by depositing the $2,500 back into your bank account to immediately pay off the credit card with the $2,500 limit. This process usually takes about 2 - 3 weeks and the process combined with other manufactured spending processes boosts your credit score to a maximum of 850 in a matter of 1 year as well as gives you all of the perks of the credit card such as travel deals and whatever else. However, with this travel system no credit card is needed. Only $1,200 of cash income every 4 weeks and the travel gear is needed.<BR><BR>

<B>Proving Who You Are, Proving Your Exact Location and Why You Need To</B><HR>

<B>* Proving Your Location</B><BR>
You will always need to be able to prove who you are and where you are at long distance to your people 24/7 down to 3-10 feet with 100% accuracy by using G.P.S. coordinates within a 3-10 foot radius and within a 3 foot altitude of the 3-10 foot radius of your exact location with line-by-line logs. I have written certain digital programming code and digital web applications that enables you to do this without the use of mainstream social media services or in combination with the use of mainstream social media services. This should make it extremely difficult for anyone to modify the G.P.S. coordinates reported unless they get physical access to the web server that is running the web applications that receieve and store the G.P.S coordinate with altitude logs.<BR><BR>

As of 2023 the 5th generation radio type and other types of 5g cellular networks are difficult for criminal organization to spoof by using IMSI catchers because of the frequency pitch. It is also difficult for them to G.P.S. jam and G.P.S. location spoof the 5g cell phones that use the higher 5g frequencies. G.P.S. location jamming is easily defeated by staying out in the open where everyone can see you and by moving to an area where your electronic devices cannot be spoofed or jammed as well as by using the G.P.S. reporting log for an exact foot by foot traceback of the device. The web application keeps a perfect log of G.P.S. coordinates by movement at 1 - 5 second interval updates in a 24 hour log separated by Day, Month and Year so if G.P.S. jamming or spoofing ever occurred at any point in time in any location that is traveled through or lived in then the log from the private server could be read and all of the steps and movement of the carried device could be traced to the point of jamming or spoofing. This is a very good thing so as to secure your well-being from criminal organizations.<BR><BR>

Mainstream social media makes it possible for those who are in control of it to change / modify the uploaded images and information as well as the timestamps of the posted information on a whim and as of the year ~2023 most social media service providers have given the U.S. Government as well as other country governments private access to your personal information as well as provides them the tools to login to your accounts while you are logged in without you knowing about it and allow them to change the information and data posted at their discretion. These social media services are: FaceBook, Twitter and others. This could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on who you are and where you are located in your current travels because every area and jurisdiction in the world is different. When traveling you do not want the information to change because you want your friends and family to know where you are at down to 3-10 feet in radius and 3 feet in altitude of that 3-10 foot radius at all times. By renting or keeping a private Web Server with these Web Applications and Mobile Device Applications you can be sure that the information will not change once the original data is posted to that private Web Server.<BR><BR>

Nearly all of the Web Application Software, Operating Systems and Content Management Systems available to the public are completely backdoored and the encryption algorithms themselves are backdoored by the U.S. Government. If this becomes a problem then you cannot rely only on these services to store the images / videos / information because obviously you would not want the information to change so as to secure your well-being. You will instead need to use a paid-for private server or setup a web server at home in addition to using public social media services for use as long distance communication and updates when you leave. If you cannot prove who you are to your friends / family / people down to 3 - 10 feet in radius and 3 feet in altitude at long distance from their locations then you place yourself in extreme risks.<BR><BR>

Every tourist location is watched by the local criminal groups. They usually gather information on travelers for different criminal purposes. For example: In high traffic tourist areas such as in Oahu, Hawaii there are more than 100,000 visitors who fly in and out of this location every day. Due to amount of people who fly in and out of Oahu, Hawaii each and every day this makes it extremely difficult for Law Enforcement to prove any crimes in this location. If you are the victim of a crime in this location chances are you will not likely be able to prove it. If you undergo the training in this document it is highly unlikely you will become a victim of any crime in any location. Tourist areas have a completely different set of rules compared to other areas so as to attract income for the travel area.<BR><BR>

<B>* Establishing Legal Traceback and Why You Need To</B><BR>
By holding your identity documents up to the cameras at the stores, on the transportation systems and by showing your identity documents to the people who work in the stores along with the action of buying something from the store with a debit or credit card that is in your name and is traceable to your home address that is also linked to several friends and family addresses you can establish a legal traceback of your identity information to that specific location at that exact point in time unless the video camera recordings are deleted at a later time either deliberately or because of the stores' or transportation systems' inability to store the video recordings longer than a certain amount of time. Usually the in store video camera recordings are deleted after 2 weeks from the point of the recording timestamp unless there is a seen and reported criminal incident because the store is not capable of storing the video recordings because they do not have the ability or the means to store hundreds of thousands of terabytes of video data. In store video camera recordings are usually only saved if there is a seen and reported crime in the area.<BR><BR>

Purcashing something at the store with a credit or debit card alone does not prove that it is you making the purchase therefore it does not prove your location. By simply running the card at the store you can establish a traceback to that location at that exact
point in time.<BR><BR>

Never go anywhere without an acceptable form of identification because by simply being there and showing your face to people in the area without an identification document is not enough for anyone in that area to identify you and trace
your origins back to your friends and family if in the event something happens to you after that point in time. If you do not have any traceback to your location and no one knows your exact location
and identity information it is very easy for anyone or any group of people to kill you and then disappear you without a trace. If you are big it won't matter. If you are trained in hand to hand combat it won't matter. It does not matter how long you have physically
trained for hand to hand offense and defense. If you are outnumbered and you can't get away you are going to die. You have up to 5 minutes to prove your location or you risk death up to 85% of the time. Assuming there is no one else that looks like you most criminal groups will not risk killing and disappearing someone if there is legal, documented traceback to your location that proves beforehand that they are planning to kill you or do something to you and they are already identified.<BR><BR>

Most people do not remember names and faces, they remember the information on the identification documents especially if the identification document such as your ID Card is shown to the recording video cameras in the stores and in the area. Investigators only go off of the documentation at hand and the world of investigations, law enforcement and the entire judicial system is extremely corrupt so if there is trailing documentation that leads everyone including friends and family right to your current location you do not need to worry about being disappeared because they will not be able to fabricate documentation or alter documentation to trick a future investigation if there were one. This process it not automatic you must intentionally and consciously do this several times a day every day that you travel.<BR><BR>

High traffic tourist areas sometimes attract up to 25 million people a year or more and places like these make it almost impossible for investigators and law enforcement to prove any crimes in the area if they happen. Always document your travels by taking pictures of all of the physical and digital tickets that you have purchased and store them
on your mobile electronic devices. Only show the tickets to friends and family on social media after the physical travel from point to point is complete just in case the schedules or routes have changed at any point in the entire travel itenerary.<BR><BR>

<B>* Making Your Presence Known In The Area</B><BR>
You can make your presence known in the area that you are in by talking to the people who work in the stores and in the businesses in that area. Show your ID Card to people who work in the stores and in the businesses in the area that you are in and show your ID Card to the cameras in the stores and in the businesses and let them know what your name is, where you are from and where you are planning to go to. Try to relate to them and
make conversations with them.<BR><BR>

<B>* Securing The Electronics</B><BR>
Never use a fingerprint, iris scan or face scan on any of the electronics to unlock them. Always use a pin code, a pattern or a typed password and change it frequently without anyone seeing the pin code, pattern or typed password change. When performing the pin code, pattern or typed password change always do this up against a wall where no cameras or people can see the change. All cell phones and laptops can be unlocked by enemies if they take your hand, face or eye and hold it to the cell phone device to unlock it if in the event they are around you while you are sleeping or if in the event you are ever knocked out or killed.<BR><BR>

It is also possible to use clear tape to copy a fingerprint and then use it on the cell phone fingerprint sensor to unlock it. Once this happens and if a pin code is not set on the device the enemy
or enemy group can then unlock the cell phone with your own finger, face or iris and then take physical control of the connected accounts on the device such as social media accounts and their data in order
to trick your friends and family about your location after having disposed of your body. Be sure to set a pin code lock on the SIM card itself and flash your device with official LineageOS or a customized Linux Operating System for mobile use. If the enemy ever gets your fingerprints they could completely clone your fingerprints in a sillicone apparatus and use it in any biometric system later on.<BR><BR>

If the SIM card itself is set with a pin code this will make it more difficult to remove that SIM card and clone it. SIM cloning involves removing the SIM card and then duplicating it so that a laptop with a SIM card slot can intercept the messages and phone calls in real time. If in the event you suspect that or the device software scanners shows that your
SIM card has been cloned you must change the SIM card by buying a new SIM card from the store and then activate it in the cell phone service provider website portal. Once the cell phone device has been setup correctly it cannot be physically cloned or remotely hacked unless the perpetrater manages to get physical access to the device to install a RAT or Remote Access Trojan.<BR><BR>

Remote Access Trojans are usually malicious software that allows the malicious hacker to remotely watch your cell phone and or laptop in real time as well as log your key strokes, send commands to the electronic devices and remotely operate your electronic device. Many files on the Internet are injected with undetectable RATs that cannot be detected by Malware scanners even by Linux and FreeBSD OS scanners. Refer to the electronics security hardening guide for
the electronics to secure the electronics.<BR><BR>

<B>* Instant Information Gathering On Targets</B><BR>
The combined system created by my team can instantly gather real time information on targets and spread the live videos by Smart Glasses around to all ~1,200 members on the server<BR><BR>

<B>* Proving Traceback</B><BR><BR>

<B>* Dealing With PickPockets, Room Thieves and Switcheroos</B><BR>
<B>PickPockets</B> are small gangs that usually work for the larger gangs in the area. The shown travel gear is nice and tight. By wearing tight clothing it makes it very difficult for PickPockets
to steal anything from you. Usually PickPockets will use a razor blade to cut the backpack or the pockets to steal a wallet or anything valuable. By staying away from crowded areas while traveling
with this gear you will reduce your chances of being PickPocketed up to 99% of the time<BR><BR>

<B>Room Thieves</B> are usually the people that work in the hotels, motels and other places. Room Thieves including AirBnB operators work in these places and
coordinate with the other gangs in the area to steal valuables from customers. By only taking your backpack with you when traveling and by living out of it rigorously while traveling and
by also taking it with you when you leave the rooms you stay in you can reduce the chances of your possessions being stolen up to 100% of the time. If your backpack is securely worn it cannot be taken off of your back by anyone walking, running or biking by you.<BR><BR>

<B>Switcheroos</B> are Room Thieves and others that will switch your authentic belongings out with fake products or damaged
products that are the exact same make and model. An example of a Switcheroo is someone that is in a gang and owns
a damaged or fake pair of RayBan glasses that are the exact same make and model of the new and non-damaged RayBan glasses
that you own and have with you. They would usually switch out the authentic item with the fake version while you are not looking so they can get the real thing or get the newer
one for free. Think of a gang that owns a Ranchero car of a certain make and model and they decide to go and scope out the same make and model vehicle in town so they can get a brand new carburetor out of it for free by popping the hood and then by taking
the carburetor part and switching it out with the damaged carburetor part in their Ranchero. You can always beat the Switcheroos by owning extremely customized gear. If the travel gear is original, custom made and or extremely customized it cannot be duplicated
because it cannot be bought anywhere.. if it cannot be bought anywhere else then it cannot be switched out with yours.<BR><BR>

<B>* Food, Fast Food and Fast Hand Prepared Food - What Should I Eat ?</B><BR>
Fast Food restaurants such as U.S. McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell as well as foreign Fast Food restaurants are not acceptable meals. There are many problems with places like these because you cannot actually watch the employees make the food and you have absolutely no idea what they are putting into the food and into the drinks. It is possible for them to spit in the food or put in their own bodily fluids into the food and into the drinks that they are preparing for you. This can make you very sick especially if the employees have Chlamydia or Trichinosis. The food itself is completely disgusting and will deplete vitamins and nutrients from your body. These Fast Food locations and their knockoffs can be found in numerous countries and locations. Smart travelers will never touch or consume any food like this. Smart travelers will instead go to the grocery store in the area to get clean, sealed food that will replenish the body with vitamins and nutrients. If you cannot physically watch the employees prepare the food I would advise to not ever touch or eat that food. Locations like these are also a breeding ground for criminal activity such as drugging people in the area so that the local criminals can get whatever they want out of them. The point of traveling is to experience the culture and the people, obviously so often times a friend can be made in the area where that friend's family will prepare the authentic food of the area for you or you can look it up and make it yourself at the place you are renting. Southern French, German, Norwegian foods are completely different than U.S. foods and the food is often grown there in the country itself.<BR><BR>

<B>* Evaluating Dangerous Travel Areas and Traveling Around Them Through Safe Ones</B><BR><BR>

<B>* Where To Take Pictures and Why You Should Not Take Pictures With Anyone You Don't Know</B><BR>
It is acceptable and safe to take pictures by yourself in the areas that you travel in but it is not acceptible and it is not safe to take pictures with strangers or with anyone that you do not know personally. By taking a picture with anyone that you do not know personally and posting that to the Internet or to social media is welcoming danger and trouble into your life. It is acceptible and safe to take pictures with tourist guides that are published in magazines and television.<BR><BR>

<B>* Most Countries Are Very Dangerous and They Will Get You Trapped There</B><BR>
Most countries in the world are extremely dangerous and many places including the tourist areas have criminals who are in with the local Government that will conspire to get you legally trapped there by having you framed or setup. Only certain lists of countries are safe for Westerners and only certain areas within those lists of countries are safe for Westerners. Generally U.S. California, Oregon and many places in Western-Europe are safe in approved areas if you do not already personally know people in those areas. If you do know people in these areas you can be sure that you will be safe.<BR><BR>

<B>* Preparing and Creating Your Real Travel Social Media Accounts</B><BR><BR>

<B>* Preparing and Creating Your Fake Travel Social Media Accounts</B><BR>
For your fake travel social media accounts you only neeed to create one of them on each of these public social media platforms and do not login to any of them while traveling: Google, FaceBook, InstaGram and Twitter. Use your real picture and distort it a little bit, use a fake name and put a fake address in a random town on the accounts for everyone to see. Do not login to these accounts while you are travelling because you do not want Google, FaceBook, InstaGram or Twitter to be confused about your real whereabouts. Create the Google Voice VoIP phone number and give out these accounts and the VoIP phone number to any people that you encounter in your travels that you feel is a threat to your safety. You can use these fake social media accounts as a honeypot to see the information and the friends lists of the people that you encounter in your travels that you feel is a threat to your safety. You can then network block these lists of people on your real social media accounts from seeing your real social media accounts and the data.<BR><BR>

<B>* Preparing and Creating Your Identity Data Files For Social Media, Electronic Mail Message and Friends and Family</B><BR>
* Take clear and professional 4K or higher resolution pictures and videos of yourself up against a white background at all angles as well as with yourself holding up your palms.<BR>
* Take clear and professional 4K or higher resolution pictures and videos of your birth certificate, social security card, identity cards, insurance cards front and back and any other identification documents.<BR>
* Take clear and professional 4K or higher resolution pictures and videos of yourself holding up your birth certificate, social security card, identity cards front and back against your chest.<BR>
* Take clear and professional 4K or higher resolution pictures and videos of yourself dipping your hands in ink and then placing your hands on a white paper to imprint your fingerprints and palm prints onto the paper.<BR>
* Take clear and professional 4K or higher resolution pictures and videos of yourself showing your gums and your teeth pattern.<BR>
* Take clear and professional 4K or higher resolution pictures and videos of a recent X-Ray at the X-Ray machine at your doctor's direction.<BR>
Do not share this information to the Internet, instead organize this information and data on a computer and then burn the data onto a DVD and USB storage keys as well as print out the pictures and give copies of it to close friends and family. If something happens to you at any point in time in your travels you can always be identified long distance by the friends and family you gave this information to. Unfortunately traveling can be extremely dangerous and if in the event you are injured or if you die you will need to be found and identified by your friends and family long distance as well as by the local authorities.<BR><BR>

<B>Long Distance Voice and Video Conversations</B><BR>
When having long distance voice and video conversations such as with family and friends always have the video conversations with your back up against a wall in the area. Always perform a random set
of gestures in the video so that you can demonstrate to your friends and your family that videos are not pre-recorded on either end. This will make it to where the videos cannot be reproduced or recreated if in the event the videos are recorded against your knowledge and or your will. If they are recorded against your knowledge and or your will the videos cannot be used by a threat-actor to trick a community of friendlies about your current whereabouts because there will be nothing in the background and it will not be believeable.<BR><BR>

<B>Expert Self Care and Mobile Hygiene Techniques</B><HR>

<B>* Oral and Tooth Care</B><BR>
Mix together all 10 different $1 travel size toothpastes with hydrogen peroxide and baking soda mixed into a paste. Thoroughly brush teeth with medium to hard grade manual tooth brush. Use DenTek &copy; &trade; tooth cleaning kit or a different tooth cleaning kit to scrape and clean each individual tooth front back and sides for 1 hour each session throughout the day for a total time of 6 - 8 hours while brushing intermittently with this mix. Manual tooth cleaning should be done every 2 - 3 weeks. Teeth will be cleaner, whiter and stronger than much of the population. Tooth cleaning sessions should be done once every 2 â€“ 3 weeks and brush at least 1 times per day with the 10 different $1 toothbrush mixes mixed together.<BR><BR>

<B>* Skin Care</B><BR>
Mix together all 4 different $1 travel size lotions and creams with the specialized and custom made creams and vitamin paste that contain 2,000%+ vitamin A, B, C, D, E, K, collagen, biotin, copper and more. Leave this paste on the skin for 8 hours while sleeping. The vitamin paste mixed with lotions will get absorbed into the skin for permanent reversal of daily skin damage.<BR><BR>

<B>* Internal Organ Care</B><BR><BR>

Contrary to popular belief especially with unexperienced travelers it is actually extremely difficult if not impossible to get sick or contract any diseases while traveling. This is because most people
that are traveling have a lot of money at that point in time and they are not sick and they do not have any diseases because if they were they would not be able to travel.<BR><BR>
